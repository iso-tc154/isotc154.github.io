== Scope

This standard specifies the elements, among those defined in XML Advanced Electronic Signatures (XAdES), that enable verification of a digital signature over a long period of time.

ISO 14533-2:2012 does not give new technical specifications about the digital signature itself, nor new restrictions of usage of the technical specifications about the digital signatures which has already existed.
