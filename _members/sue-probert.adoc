Sue is Co-Chair 7372/UNTDED Joint Maintenance Agency and the Chair of UN/CEFACT.

In March 2003 Sue formed the independent consultancy SEPIAeb Ltd.

Sue has many years experience working in the computer industry as programmer, systems analyst, software designer, trainer, training course designer, presenter, consultant and technical author.

She is a data modeller focussing on the area of paper and electronic documentation exchange requirements particularly in the international trade and transport arena. She is a keen advocate of Trade Facilitation and believe fervently that modern communications methods will play an increasingly significant role in the simplification of cross-border trade and governmental procedures.

She has in-depth knowledge of the formats and uses of standard international trade, transport, financial and customs UN Aligned paper documents and a profound knowledge of the UN/EDIFACT, ANSI.X12 and XML message exchange standards.

She contributes actively to eBusiness standardisation work at UK, European and International level. I am the Lead Editor responsible for leading the development of the UN/CEFACT Core Component Library and the UK HoD to the ISO TC 154 responsible for data element naming and defining for cross-border trade. I am a regular contributor to the work of the World Customs Organisation data modelling team (DMPT) and I am an endorsed trainer of the WCO Data Model to the private sector.
