Ray is recently retired from the Library of Congress where he spent
the past 36 years, during which he was the principal author or
editor of many bibliographic related protocols and schemes
including Z39.50; SRU/CQL; MODS, MADS, and PRIMIS XML Schemas; and
EDTF (the Extended Date and Time format, developed at the Library
of Congress, which is an integral part of ISO 8601-2019 Part 2 -
Extensions) and several IETF RFCs.

He has contributed to the development of many other ISO, NISO, IETF, and W3C standards and
has represented LC in the W3C for the past 20 years. For the past
several years he has been the principal ontologist for the
development of BIBFRAME (the bibliographic framework based on
linked data and RDF, to eventually replace the MARC bibliographic
format).

Although retired, Ray remains engaged with several of
these efforts.
Ray was the Convenor of ISO/TC 154/WG 5 from 2018 to 2019/04.
