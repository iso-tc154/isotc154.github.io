== Scope

This document specifies the elements, among those defined in PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES), that enable verification of a digital signature over a long period of time.
It does not give new technical specifications about the digital signature itself, nor new restrictions of usage of the technical specifications about the digital signatures which already exist.
