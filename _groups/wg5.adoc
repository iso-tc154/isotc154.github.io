      https://www.itu.int[ITU] is a Category A liaison with ISO/TC 154, with specific
      interest in the activities of WG 5.

      From its inception in 1865, ITU-T has driven a contribution-led, consensus-based approach to standards development in which all countries and companies, no matter how large or small, are afforded equal rights to influence the development of ITU-T Recommendations. From its beginnings as a body standardizing international telegraph exchange, through its formative role in telecommunications, and in today’s converged ICT ecosystem, ITU-T has provided the world’s best facilities to the global standardization community and remains the world’s only truly global ICT standards body.

      ITU-T is the standardization arm of ITU, the United Nations specialized agency for information and communication technologies – ICTs.
