== Mission

It is the vision of ISO/TC 154 that all parties in the supply and value chain use standardized data exchange to reduce cost in managing the processes in the private and public domain and to foster trade facilitation.

The mission of ISO/TC 154 is both to undertake and to facilitate the development and maintenance of international standards for electronic business in the supply and value chain.

These standards cover data exchange regardless of the media used.

Wherever possible, ISO/TC 154 fosters harmonisation between and within international standards development organizations, particularly through the Memorandum of Understanding between the International Electrotechnical Commission, the International Organization for Standardization, the International Telecommunication Union and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning standardization in the field of electronic business.

== Scope

Development and maintenance of application specific meta standards for:

* process specification (in the absence of development by other technical committees);
* data specification with content;
* forms-layout (paper / electronic).

Development and maintenance of standards for:

* process identification (in the absence of development by other technical committees);
* data identification.

Maintenance of the EDIFACT-Syntax.
